# Google Scholar Cron scraper
A very self centred scraper of Google Scholar that returns publications (with citation counts) at regular intervals. This repo takes and bastardises a few key functions from the [scholar](https://github.com/jkeirstead/scholar) repo.

If you want to change the id that is scraped, just replace the one in the `get_citations.R` file with another id.
